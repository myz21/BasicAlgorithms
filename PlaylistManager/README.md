# Dynamic Music Playlist Manager

## Overview
This project is a dynamic music playlist manager implemented in Java using both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. The application simulates a music playlist with basic features such as adding, removing, displaying songs, and extended features like moving songs and playing previous/next tracks.

### Singly Linked List
- Add a song to the playlist
- Remove a song from the playlist

### Doubly Linked List
- Add a song to the playlist
- Remove a song from the playlist
- Move a song to a new position

- Reverse the playlist order
- Search for a song in the playlist
- Start playing from the first song

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
3. Compile and run the `Homework1` class to interact with the playlist manager.

## Code Structure
- `SinglyLinkedList` class: Manages the playlist using a singly linked list.
- `DoublyLinkedList` class: Manages the playlist with additional features using a doubly linked list.
- `Song` class: Represents a song with title, artist, and duration.
- `Node` class: Represents a node in the linked list containing song data.
