# Algorithm Problem Solutions Repository

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various algorithm problems that I have solved as part of my **Computer Engineering (CENG) courses** and **self-learning efforts**. The problems cover a wide range of topics and are implemented in different programming languages.

## Categories
The problems in this repository are organized based on different algorithmic concepts:

- **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms** (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, etc.)
- **Dynamic Programming** (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
- **Graph Algorithms** (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, etc.)
- **Recursion & Backtracking** (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, etc.)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (Huffman Encoding, Activity Selection, etc.)
- **Mathematical Algorithms** (Prime Numbers, GCD, LCM, etc.)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant category to explore solutions.
3. Run the solutions using the appropriate compiler or interpreter.

## Contribution
If you have suggestions or improvements for any solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
