# CENG113: Algorithms - Spring Semester Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains all the algorithm problems I have solved during the **CENG113** course in the Spring semester. Each solution is stored in a separate file, with the filename indicating the specific algorithm problem I attempted to solve.

## Algorithm Problems Solved

Below is a list of algorithm problems that I have worked on in the course, with each file containing the solution to a particular problem. The filename of each solution is structured to reflect the specific problem or algorithm used.

- **File Naming Convention**:  
  The name of each file follows the format: `ProblemName_AlgorithmName.java`, where:
  - `ProblemName` is the descriptive name of the problem being solved.
  - `AlgorithmName` refers to the algorithm or technique applied to solve the problem.

For example:
- `Slide7_BubbleSort.java` → Solving the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `PS_10_2_displayStringRecursively.java` → Displaying a string recursively as part of Problem Set 10.


## How to Run the Solutions

Each solution file is written in **Java**, and can be compiled and executed as follows:

1. **Compile** the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac ProblemName_AlgorithmName.java
   ```

2. **Run** the compiled Java program:
   ```bash
   java ProblemName_AlgorithmName
   ```

### Example

To run the solution for the **Bubble Sort** algorithm:
- File name: `Slide7_BubbleSort.java`
- Commands:
  ```bash
  javac Slide7_BubbleSort.java
  java Slide7_BubbleSort
  ```
